# Realtime-Pose-Estimation
Build my own AI powered gym tracker using AI Powered Pose estimation. Detects 33 different landmarks within a human body using a mediapipe framework and all of this is done in real-time through webcam feed. Make detection, extract the landmarks or joint coordinate and then find the angle between the joints and then draw them.
